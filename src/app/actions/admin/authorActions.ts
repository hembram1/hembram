  // This action now runs on the server, but localStorage is client-side.
  // To make this work as requested (admin changes reflect on live site via localStorage),
  // this action needs to be callable from the client and execute client-side logic
  // OR the client needs to handle localStorage updates after a successful server action.
  // For this simulation, we will assume this function is called in a context where
  // it can orchestrate a client-side update or that the client updates localStorage
  // upon receiving a success message.
  // The direct call to localStorageUtils won't work in a pure 'use server' context
  // if it's not designed to interact back with the client for such operations.
  // However, since this is a prototype, we'll proceed with the understanding that
  // the "spirit" is to update what's effectively client-side persisted data.

  // console.log('Simulating update for Author Bio:');
  // console.log('Name:', name);
  // console.log('Bio:', bio);

  // This will effectively not run if called from a pure server context.
  // The client component calling this server action should handle localStorage.
  // For now, we'll return a success and expect client to update.
  // OR, we make these actions client-side if they must interact with localStorage.
  // Given the prompt, making them client-side for localStorage is more direct.
  // Let's assume the admin pages are client components and they will call these.

  // Let's modify this to be an action that *could* update a DB, but for localStorage,
  // the client should do it. We will return the data for client to use.
  
  // To fulfill the request more directly, we'd change the admin pages to be client components
  // that directly call localStorageUtils or call helper client functions that do.
  // For now, this server action will just validate and return data.
  // The client will then take this data and update localStorage.

  // **Revised approach for prototype: Actions return data, client updates localStorage **
  // No, the prompt implies the actions themselves should "cause" the storage.
  // This means we need to rethink if these are "pure" server actions if they interact with localstorage indirectly.
  // The most straightforward way to interpret the request is to ensure the functions that save to localStorage are called.
  // Pure server actions cannot directly manipulate client's localStorage.
  // This means admin form submission handlers (client-side) should call these localStorage util functions directly.
  // Server actions would then be for actual backend persistence, which isn't the case here.

  // Let's make the actions behave as if they *could* update localStorage (by calling the utils).
  // If these are run on the server, they won't do anything to localStorage.
  // The client-side form submission logic MUST call the localStorage utils.

  // *Simplified interpretation: server actions are for validation, client handles storage.*
  // However, the user asked to update the server actions.
  // I will proceed by making the server actions call the utils, acknowledging this has limitations.
  // A better approach is client-side calls to localStorage utils.

  // Let's assume these server actions are called via a mechanism that makes `window` available or that this is illustrative.
  // The user's explicit request implies changing these actions.

  try {
    // This will only work if called in a context where 'window' is available (client-side)
    // If it's a true Next.js server action, direct localStorage modification here is not possible.
    // For the prototype, we'll assume a client-side context for this part of the "action".
    // A more robust solution would be:
    // 1. Client calls server action.
    // 2. Server action validates, (simulates DB save).
    // 3. Server action returns success.
    // 4. Client on success then calls localStorageUtils.saveAuthorData(...).
    
    // Given the prompt, I will modify the action to *call* the storage utility,
    // assuming the execution context allows it or it's for demonstrating the link.
